Stranded is a survival/exploration game set in a remote tropical island. The main character is a castaway. While travelling on his raft on an island complex, he crashed on the shallows. Washed up on another island with a broken raft and nowhere else to go, he needs to find the necessary components to repair it: wood, rope and rags.

His time is running out, as he will die of starvation if he doesn't leave immediately. Can he make it out?
